 * theme default
 *
 *  This theme is generated twice under different media queries.
 *  This means that when the .theme--default class is attached to body, then
 *  the page will receive custom CSS properties that depend on the system
 *  theme.
 *
 *  theme---light and theme---dark are Sass mixins that are reused
 *  both here and in their respective theme classes.  theme---light is used to
 *  define .theme--light, and likewise theme---dark is used to define
 *  .theme--dark.
 *
 *  So by switching the class on body from .theme--default to .theme--light/dark
 *  we can explicitly override the automatic selection in .theme--default.
