/*****************************************************************************
 * theme default
 *
 *  Default color scheme (light).
 *
 *  Colors are named using application-level-transparency.  e.g.
 *
 *  background-200, is applied to backgrounds, level 200 color, and is opaque
 *  text-100-400, is applied to text, level 100 color, and is 50% transparent.
 *
 *  Note that I'm using a 0 - 1000 numbering convention for both color and
 *  transparency to allow fine gradation in future and consistency with
 *  popular schemes.
 *
 *  For transparency number, no number is opaque, 900 is almost transparent.
